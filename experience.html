                <h3>Background</h3>
                <h4>Academics</h4>
                <p>My Academic Background is mainly engineering (Math & Physics) with an undergraduate degree of Civil Engineering from 
                    ITESM (Monterrey Institute of Technology) at Monterrey, Mexico. During my undergraduate career, there was the opportunity 
                    for experiences abroad at UNCC (University of North Carolina at Charlotte) in the United States & NTU (Nanyang Technological 
                    University) in Singapore. Also, a graduate experience of 6 months studying Earthquake Engineering at TODAI (The University 
                    of Tokyo) in Japan & a graduate degree of MSc. Offshore Technology at NUS (National University of Singapore) in Singapore.<br>
                    <br>
                    After some Work Experience in the Construction Industry (2018-2020), I came back to studies on November 2020, by taking 
                    online courses for Software Engineering on my own (Python, Machine Learning, JS Data Structures & Algorithms). Then, I took 
                    a Full-Stack Web & Mobile App Development Bootcamp of 6 months consisting in: HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, React Web, React 
                    Native & Back-end [NodeJS, Mongodb, Express].<br>
                    <br>
                    During 2021, I have been deeply involved in the crypto ecosystem in different aspects. I started my journey by taking an 
                    online course called "Blockchain: The New Industrial Revolution 2021" from Udemy. I have read a lot of information 
                    from blockchain, there are many new concepts in the industry, such as: protocols, chains, DAOs, layer2, liquidity 
                    provider, impermanent loss, DApps, etc., that are required to understand better this new industry. Web3 is part of 
                    this new industrial revolution and it has attracted my attention a lot.<br>
                </p>
                <h4>Work</h4>
                <p>My Work Experience, by 2021, consists in 2 internships and 3 full-time jobs listed in chronological order:<br> 
                    <br>
                    During my undergraduate degree (2013), I did a 2-months summer internship with Schlumberger (oil & gas company) in Villahermosa, 
                    TAB, Mexico and I learned how cementing jobs, at jobsite, are done to stabilize the pipes under earth at high-pressures & high-temperatures. 
                    After I got my undergraduate degree (2015), I worked as a Construction Site Supervisor with Arch Saul Gonzalez in 4 High-Class Residential projects in Monterrey, NL, Mexico.<br>
                    <br>
                    During my graduate studies (2018), I did an internship with Intecsea (oil & gas company) at Singapore and I participated 
                    in the structural calculations of a LNG Gas Plant located in Hong Kong.<br>
                    <br>
                    After I finished my graduate school (2018), I worked in the Construction Industry with two general contractors in San 
                    Francisco, CA, US with Build Group & Guzman Construction Group for 2 and a half years and I learned the different stages 
                    that involved a construction project. I participated in a total of 4 projects in Pre-Construction & Operations; projects 
                    were buildings from 3 to 13 storeys from Post-Tension Concrete (valued on ~98M-130M USD) & Wooden Structure (valued on ~16M-20M USD).
                    My overall conclusion of this construction experience is that building projects from drawings to real life, can be extremely 
                    fun if you see the big project as a finished puzzle, and you segment all the small details in small pieces of that big puzzle.<br>
                    <br>
                    Nowadays, I'm pursuing a remote full-time job in a company or a freelancer career in the tech & blockchain industry as a Front-End Web2 or/and Web3 Developer. I feel passion 
                    in learning new things and acquiring new technical skills. My drive is to see the final product in the most optimum way by taking every single 
                    small detail in account. I like to inspire others by demonstrating that nothing is impossible if you focus on the goal and work for that vision 
                    little by little.

                        <p class="mb-0">Santino was a breath of fresh air on a project with some contentious team dynamics- always offering help and looking 
                            for ways to advance solutions to problems whenever they arose. From my perspective as a client rep, I could tell that 
                            he values people, relationships, and getting the work done efficiently. If he saw inefficiencies, he would call it 
                            out and look for ways to resolve. He has a positive attitude and integrity- I could trust that he had the best interests 
                            of the project at heart. I enjoyed working with Santino and wish him great success in his future endeavours.</p>

                        <p class="mb-0">It is my pleasure to recommend Santino Cervera. As an architectural designer, I worked with Santino (as GCG
                            construction consultant) in the past year, dealing with RFIs and on-site issues. He is a very
                            responsible person. Every time I need onsite measurements or other onsite response, he can quickly give me feedback. It is
                            helpful, especially in the COVID-19 SIP period. He has a wide knowledge of construction, it helps when we communicate. He
                            also comes up with good ideas when we have OAC meetings.
                            If you have any questions about Santino's experience and abilities with me, I am glad to further discuss why I believe he is a
                            good choice for this opportunity.</p>
